Goals:
1 - Understand Unity’s Rendering Pipeline: The developer should understand how Unity’s rendering pipeline works, including concepts like materials, shaders, lights, cameras, and post-processing effects.
2 - Master Shaders: The developer should be able to create custom shaders using Unity’s Shader Graph1[1]2[2]33. They should understand how to use nodes to create different shader effects22.
3 - Master Mesh Renderers: The developer should understand how to use mesh renderers and filters in Unity48. They should know how to render a mesh and how to use shadows, materials, and light probes48.
4 - Implement Basic Rendering Techniques: The developer should be able to implement basic rendering techniques in Unity, such as creating and applying materials, setting up lights, and using cameras.
5 - Optimize Rendering Performance: The developer should understand how to optimize rendering performance in Unity, including techniques like batching, culling, and level of detail (LOD).

Missions:
Mission 1 - Shader Basics: Learn about Unity’s Shader Graph and experiment with creating custom shaders.
Mission 2 - Mesh Renderer Basics: Learn about Unity’s mesh renderers and filters and experiment with rendering a mesh48.
Mission 3 - Space Scene: Create a space scene for your game. This should include a starry background, a spaceship (the player character), and obstacles like asteroids. Use different materials, lights, and shaders to make the scene visually appealing.
Mission 4 - Camera Control: Attach a camera to the spaceship so that it follows the spaceship as it moves through space. Experiment with different camera settings to achieve the desired look and feel for your game.
Mission 5 - Post-Processing Effects: Add post-processing effects to enhance the visuals of your game. This could include effects like bloom, color grading, depth of field, etc.
**Mission 6 - Performance Optimization
